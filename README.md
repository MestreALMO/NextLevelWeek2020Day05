But What is the Next level week? It is a event with a lot of code, learning, challenges, networking and getting the participants to the next level. The event is in portuguese, so I'm translating everything and showing how the things are happening.

This code has as objective build a code that can open as app and web:
Here is how it should look like when the app is done:
